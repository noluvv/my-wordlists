# my-wordlists
wordlists i use for testing security/security testing or whatever you want to call it. use them with hydra, ncrack, hashcat, john, aircrack-ng, pretty much any cracking software

includes projects such as SecLists, cupp, and CeWL. i did not create those projects, i just added them to mine

run "git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/k4toh/my-wordlists.git" to clone SecLists and cupp along with main project, or just run "git submodule update --init --recursive" in main directory after cloning if you cloned it regularly
